## Users of Kolla

The open source project Kolla from the [OpenInfra Foundation](https://openinfra.dev) is
used in OSISM for the life cycle management of OpenStack. Kolla’s mission is to provide
production-ready containers and deployment tools for operating OpenStack clouds. Kolla has
been actively developed by a very diverse team for 10 years and is one of the most common
(if not the most common) life cycle management tool for OpenStack.

The container images provided by Kolla are not only used by Kolla itself. They are also used
in TripleO, the basis for the now discontinued
[RedHat OpenStack Platform](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/openstack-platform),
and the [OpenStack Kubernetes Operators](https://github.com/openstack-k8s-operators),
the basis for the new
[OpenStack Services on OpenShift from Redhat](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/red-hat-openstack-services-openshift-next-generation-red-hat-openstack-platform).

Here is an overview of all the companies we know that use Kolla and the cloud infrastructures
in which Kolla is used.
