The release notes build on each other. When upgrading from 6.0.2 to 7.0.4, you should
therefore not only read and take into account the release notes for 7.0.4 but also the
previous release notes. The same applies to an update from, for example, 7.0.2 to 7.0.4.
The release notes for 7.0.3 must then also be taken into account.
