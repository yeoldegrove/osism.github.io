# Configuration Repository

The configuration required for an OSISM managed cluster is stored in a single Git
monorepo, the configuration repository.

## Creating a new configuration repository

The initial content for this configuration repository is generated using the
[Cookiecutter](https://github.com/osism/cfg-cookiecutter).

Cookiecutter generates a simple initial configuration for your new cluster by prompting
you for the basic details of the new cluster.

The configuration repository is not created on the future Manager node. It is created on a
local workstation. If the local workstation cannot be used for this purpose, a dedicated
virtual system can be used. For more information on this topic, refer to the
[Seed Deploy Guide](../deploy-guide/seed.md)..

### Step 1: Preparation

First decide where to store your Git repository The content generated by the cookiecutter in
the `output/configuration` directory is committed to a new Git repository. By default, the
configuration repository is assumed to be on GitHub. This can also be GitLab or an internal
Git service as well.

Host and path to the Git repository are specified by the `git_` parameters. These are
requested in step 2. The `git_` parameters do not specify the path to the cookiecutter
to use.

```
  [8/20] git_host (github.com):
  [9/20] git_port (22):
  [10/20] git_repository (YOUR_ORG/YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY): regiocloud/configuration
  [11/20] git_username (git):
  [12/20] git_version (main):
```

In this case, the generated configuration in the `output/configuration` directory is
stored on GitHub in the `regiocloud/configuration` repository.

See the [parameter reference](#parameter-reference) for more details. The parameters
listed there will be queried during the execution of Cookiecutter.

### Step 2: Run Cookiecutter

1. The directory `output` is created and used as output volume. It is only necessary to create the empty
   directory here.

   ```
   mkdir output
   ```

2. The Cookiecutter runs inside a container. [Docker must be usable on the system](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
   where the Cookiecutter will be used. It should also work with Podman.

   ```
   docker run \
     -e TARGET_UID="$(id -u)" \
     -e TARGET_GID="$(id -g)" \
     -v $(pwd)/output:/output \
     --rm -it quay.io/osism/cookiecutter
   ```

3. A few parameters are requested. The parameters are documented in detail in the [Parameters reference](#parameters-reference).

   If you want to use the `latest` version, this is done using the `manager_version` parameter. By default,
   this is always set to the latest stable version.

   ```
   manager_version [7.0.4]: latest
   ```

   If the `manager_version` parameter is set to `latest` it is also possible to explicitly
   set the `openstack_version` and the `ceph_version` explicitly.

   ```
   [1/19] with_ceph (1):
   [2/19] with_keycloak (0):
   [3/19] ceph_network(192.168.64.0/19):
   [4/19] ceph_version (quincy):
   [5/19] domain (osism.xyz):
   [6/19] fqdn_external (api.osism.xyz):
   [7/19] fqdn_internal (api-int.osism.xyz):
   [8/19] git_host (github.com):
   [9/19] git_port (22):
   [10/19] git_repository (YOUR_ORG/YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY):
   [11/19] git_username (git):
   [12/19] git_version (main):
   [13/19] ip_external (192.168.96.9):
   [14/19] ip_internal (192.168.32.9):
   [15/19] manager_version (7.0.4):
   [16/19] name_server (149.112.112.112):
   [17/19] ntp_server (de.pool.ntp.org):
   [18/19] openstack_version (2023.2):
   [19/19] project_name (configuration):
   ```

### Step 3: Upload the new configuration to the remote git repository

Add the initial configuration state to the repository. How to add a deploy key on GitHub is documented in
[Managing deploy keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/managing-deploy-keys).
Read permissions are sufficient.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_ORG/YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY.git YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY
$ cp -r output/configuration/{*,.gitignore} YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY
$ cd YOUR_NEW_CONFIGURATION_REPOSITORY
$ git add -A .
$ git commit -m "Initial commit after bootstrap"
$ git push
```

The content is now committed to the Git repository that was created earlier in the process.

:::warning

The `secrets` directory is not stored in the Git repository. Its contents can be
stored in a trusted location.

The `secrets` directory contains an SSH key pair which is used as the deploy key to
make the configuration repository available on the manager node later. Write access
is not required. The public SSH key is stored in the `secrets/id_rsa.configuration.pub` file.

:::

### Step 4: Post-processing of the generated configuration

The configuration repository that is initially created with the Cookiecutter is not immediately usable.
For example, the inventory needs to be built. All other information can be found in the
[Configuration Guide](../configuration-guide/). Use `git` to version all your configuration changes.

The following 6 points must be changed after the initial creation of the configuration repository.

1. [Secrets](#secrets)
2. [Manager inventory](#manager-inventory)
3. [Global inventory](#global-inventory)
4. [DNS servers](#dns-servers)
5. [NTP servers](#ntp-servers)
6. [SSL certificates](#ssl-certificates)

#### Secrets

The password for Ansible Vault encrypted files, is stored in `secrets/vaultpass`. Since the `secrets` directory
is not added to the configuration repository, it is important to store it in a password vault of your choice.

The password of the generated Keepass file is `password`. This should be changed when using the Keepass file.
If possible, an existing password vault should be used.

#### Manager inventory

The information required to perform the initial bootstrap of the manager node and the initial
deployment of the manager service from the seed Node is provided in the inventory of the manager
environment.

In the Cookiecutter, a node `node01` is defined as an example in the manager inventory as well as
in the global inventory. The name of this node must be changed to match the name of the node used
as manager in your own cluster.

**Roles**

* Manager role

  The name of the node on which the manager service is to be deployed is
  added to inventory group `manager` in file `environments/manager/hosts`.

  Only the `manager` inventory group is available in `environments/manager/hosts`. There are no
  other groups there.

  ```ini title="environments/manager/hosts"
  [manager]
  node01
  ```

**Host vars**

* Ansible section

  The IP address where the node can be reached via SSH from the manager node. If DHCP is used after the
  initial provisioning to assign an initial IP address to the nodes, the address assigned via DHCP is
  initially used here and later changed to the static IP address.

  ```yaml title="environments/manager/host_vars/node01.yml"
  ansible_host: 192.168.16.10
  ```

* Generic section

  The network interface on which the internal communication of the cluster will take place. If the
  internal interface does not yet exist at the time the configuration is created, e.g. because it is a
  bond interface or VLAN interface that is only created by the static network configuration, it can be
  already used here.

  ```yaml title="environments/manager/host_vars/node01.yml"
  internal_interface: eno1
  ```

* Network section

  The static and complete network configuration of the node. Further details on creating the
  network configuration in the [network configuration guide](/docs/guides/configuration-guide/network).

  ```yaml title="environments/manager/host_vars/node01.yml"
  network_ethernets:
    eno1:
      addresses:
        - "192.168.16.10/20"
      gateway4: "192.168.16.1"
      mtu: 1500
  ```

#### Global inventory

In the Cookiecutter, a node `node01` is defined as an example in the manager inventory as well as
in the global inventory. The name of this node must be changed to match the name of the node used
as manager in your own cluster.

**Roles**

  ```ini title="inventory/20-roles"
  # Nodes that serve as controllers for Ceph, so things like the
  # Ceph Monitor service run here.
  [ceph-control]
  ````

* Ceph resource role

#### SSL certificates


## Using latest

If you want to use the latest version, this is done using the `manager_version` parameter. By default,
this is always set to the latest stable version.

```
manager_version [7.0.0]: latest
```

If the `manager_version` parameter is set to `latest` it is also possible to explicitly
set the `openstack_version` and the `ceph_version` explicitly.

## Configuration repository layout

A configuration repository always has the same layout. This section describes
the content available in a configuration repository. In the section
[Creating a new configuration repository](#creating-a-new-configuration-repository) is the creation
of a new configuration repository documented.
