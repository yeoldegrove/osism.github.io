# Proxy

In the following examples, it is assumed that the Squid proxy integrated by OSISM
is used on the first manager node. Any other proxy accessible from the nodes can
also be used here.

The Squid service can be deployed on the first manager. This is useful if no proxy
can be used in the environment. The first manager node is then used by all other nodes
as a pass-through node. Please note that this is not a caching proxy or even an air gap.
This is also possible with OSISM, but not with the help of the Squid service.

```
osism apply squid
```

## Docker

This allows Docker images to be pulled via a proxy.

```yaml title="environments/configuration.yml"
##########################################################
# proxy

docker_configure_proxy: true
docker_proxy_http: "http://{{ groups['manager'][0] }}:3128"
docker_proxy_https: "{{ docker_proxy_http }}"
```

## APT

This allows APT packages to be downloaded via a proxy.

```yaml title="environments/configuration.yml"
##########################################################
# proxy

proxy_proxies:
  http: "http://{{ groups['manager'][0] }}:3128"
  https: "http://{{ groups['manager'][0] }}:3128"
```

## Kolla

Proxy settings for containers such as magnum that need internet access.

```yaml title="environments/kolla/configuration.yml"
##########################################################
# proxy

container_http_proxy: "http://{{ groups['manager'][0] }}:3128"
container_https_proxy: "http://{{ groups['manager'][0] }}:3128"
container_no_proxy: "localhost,127.0.0.1"
```
