# Testbed

💡 With the OSISM Testbed, it is possible to run a full Sovereign Cloud Stack
deployment on an existing OpenStack environment such as Cleura or REGIO.cloud.

OSISM is the reference implementation for the infrastructure as a service layer in the
[Sovereign Cloud Stack](https://scs.community) (SCS) project. The OSISM Testbed is therefore
used in the SCS project to test and work on the Instrastructure as a Service layer.

The OSISM Testbed is intended as a playground. Further services and integration will
be added over time. More and more best practices and experiences from the productive
deployments will be included here in the future. It will become more production-like
over time. However, at no point does it claim to represent a production setup exactly.

## Requirements

### Cloud access

The prerequisite is to have an account on one of the supported OpenStack cloud providers.

It is not part of this guide to describe the registration with the individual cloud
providers. Please contact the respective cloud provider for this.

**Product**      | **Provider**  | **Profile name**
-----------------|---------------|-----------------
Cleura           | Cleura        | `cleura`
Fuga Cloud       | FUGA          | `fuga`
HuaweiCloud      | HuaweiCloud   | `huaweicloud`
OVH              | OVH           | `ovh`
OpenTelekomCloud | T-Systems     | `otc`
pluscloud open   | plusserver    | `pluscloudopen`
REGIO.cloud      | OSISM         | `regiocloud`
Wavestack        | noris network | `wavestack`

For each provider listed in the table, a predefined profile is available in the
`terraform/environments` directory. This profile contains the name of the public
network, which flavors to use, etc.

Here is an example from the profile for REGIO.cloud.

```
flavor_manager            = "SCS-4V-8-50"
flavor_node               = "SCS-8V-32-100"
volume_type               = "ssd"
image                     = "Ubuntu 22.04"
image_node                = "Ubuntu 22.04"
public                    = "public"
availability_zone         = "nova"
volume_availability_zone  = "nova"
network_availability_zone = "nova"
```

### Cloud resources

The OSISM Testbed requires at least the following project quota when using the default flavors:

**Resource** | **Quantity**         | **Note**
-------------|----------------------|-------------------------
4            | Instances            | 28 VCPUs + 104 GByte RAM
9            | Volumes              | 90 GByte volume storage
1            | Floating IP          |
1            | Keypair              |
3            | Security group       |
16           | Security group rules |
1            | Network              |
1            | Subetwork            |
6            | Ports                |
1            | Router               |

## Preparations

### Software

* `make` must be installed on the system
* `yq` must be installed on the system. [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) is a portable
  command-line YAML, JSON, XML, CSV, TOML and properties processor.
* Ansible in a current version must be installed and usable on the local workstation. Currently Ansible 8 is supported.
  Information on installing Ansible can be found in the [Ansible
  documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)
* Terraform in a current version must be installed and usable on the local workstation. Currently Terraform 1.5 is supported.
  Information on installing Terraform can be found in the [Terraform
  documentation](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)

### Custom CA

The OSISM Testbed installation currently uses hostnames in the domain `testbed.osism.xyz`.  This is a real domain
and we provide the DNS records matching the addresses used in the OSISM Testbed, so that once you connect to your testbed via a direct
link or Wireguard, you can access hosts and servers by their hostname (e.g. `ssh testbed-manager.testbed.osism.xyz`).

We also provide a wildcard TLS certificate signed by a custom CA for `testbed.osism.xyz` and `*.testbed.osism.xyz`.

This CA is always used for each testbed. The CA is not regenerated and it is not planned to change this for the next 10 years.

In order for these certificates to be recognized locally as valid, the CA
[environments/kolla/certificates/ca/testbed.crt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osism/testbed/main/environments/kolla/certificates/ca/testbed.crt)
must be imported locally.

## Getting Started

This section describes step by step how to deploy the OSISM Testbed.

1. Clone the [osism/testbed](https://github.com/osism/testbed) repository.
   The repository can also be cloned to any other location.

   ```sh
   mkdir -p ~/src/github.com/osism
   git clone https://github.com/osism/testbed ~/src/github.com/osism/testbed
   cd ~/src/github.com/osism/testbed
   ```


2. The access data for the cloud provider used is then stored in `terraform/clouds.yaml`.
   The `clouds.yaml` file is provided by the cloud provider used. Please check the documentation
   of the cloud provider you are using or their support for details.

   REGIO.cloud is used as an example. The cloud name in `clouds.yaml`
   and the environment name (value of `ENVIRONMENT`) are `regiocloud` in this case. If another cloud
   is used, replace `regioclodu` with the respective profile name from the table above.

   ```yaml
   clouds:
     regiocloud:
       auth:
         auth_url: https://keystone.services.a.regiocloud.tech/v3
         project_name: PROJECT
         username: USERNAME
         password: PASSWORD
         project_domain_name: DOMAIN
         user_domain_name: DOMAIN
   ```

   The use of application credentials is preferred. This way it is not necessary to store
   details like username or project name or sensitive information like the password in the
   `clouds.yaml` file.

   The application credentials can be found in Horizon under **Identity**. Use `OSISM testbed` as
   name and click `Create Application Credential`.

   The `clouds.yaml` file of REGIO.cloud can be used as an example for the use of
   application credentials. With another cloud provider, only the `auth_url` must then be changed
   accordingly.

   ```yaml
   clouds:
     regiocloud:
       auth:
         auth_url: https://keystone.services.a.regiocloud.tech/v3
         application_credential_id: ID
         application_credential_secret: SECRET
       auth_type: "v3applicationcredential"
   ```

3. Prepare the deployment. The versions of Ansible and Terraform are checked and necessary
   dependencies are cloned.

   ```sh
   make prepare
   ```

4. Create the infrastructure with Terraform.

   ```sh
   make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud create
   ```

5. Deploy the OSISM manager and bootstrap all nodes.

   ```sh
   make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud manager
   ```

6. Deploy all services. Depending on the cloud, the installation will take some time. Up
   to two hours is not unusual. In this step, Ceph, OpenStack and all necessary
   infrastructure services (MariaDB, RabbitMQ, ...) are deployed.

   ```sh
   make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud deploy
   ```

   Alternatively, it is also possible to deploy the services step by step directly on the
   manager. To do this, first log in to the manager with `make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud login`
   and then execute the deploy scripts one after the other. It is recommended to do this
   within a screen session.

   ```sh
   /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/001-helper-services.sh
   /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/100-ceph-services-basic.sh
   /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/200-infrastructure-services-basic.sh
   /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/300-openstack-services-basic.sh
   /opt/configuration/scripts/deploy/400-monitoring-services.sh
   ```

   Deploying the services takes some time and depends on how much bandwidth is available,
   how the instances are equipped, etc. 90-120 minutes is not unusual when Ceph and OpenStack
   are fully deployed.

7. After the deployment, you can log in to the manager via SSH.

   ```sh
   make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud login
   ```

8. If you want you can create a test project with a test user after login. It also
   creates an instance with a volume attached to a network with a router.

   ```sh
   osism apply --environment openstack test
   ```

9. When the OSISM Testbed is no longer needed, it can be deleted.

   ```sh
   make ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud clean
   ```

## Usage

### VPN access

Copy the `/home/dragon/wireguard-client.conf` file to your workstation. This is necessary
for using the web endpoints on your workstation. Rename the wireguard config file to something
like `testbed.conf`.

If you want to connect to the OSISM Testbed from multiple clients, change the client IP
address in the config file to be different on each client.

```bash
scp dragon@IP_FROM_YOUR_SERVER:/home/dragon/wireguard-client.conf /home/ubuntu/testbed.conf
```

Install wireguard on your workstation, if you have not done this before. For instructions how to do
it on your workstation, please have a look on the documentation of your used distribution. The
wireguard documentation you will find [here](https://www.wireguard.com/).

Start the wireguard tunnel.

```bash
wg-quick up /home/ubuntu/testbed.conf
```

If you do not want to use Wireguard you can also work with [sshuttle](https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle).

```sh
make sshuttle ENVIRONMENT=regiocloud
```

### Webinterfaces

All SSL enabled services within the OSISM Testbed use certs which are signed by the self-signed
[OSISM Testbed CA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/osism/testbed/main/environments/kolla/certificates/ca/testbed.crt).

If you want to access the services please choose the URL from the following table.

**Name**                 | **URL**                                           | **Username**  | **Password**                                 | **Note**

### Authentication with OIDC

Authentication with OpenID Connect (OIDC) is possible via Keycloak, which is automatically configured for the OIDC mechanism.

#### OpenStack web dashboard (Horizon) login via OIDC

For logging in via OIDC, open your browser at OpenStack Dashboard Login Page, select **Authenticate via Keycloak**, after being
redirected to the Keycloak login page, perform the login with the credentials **alice** and **password**.
After that you will be redirected back to the Horizon dashboard, where you will be logged in with the user **alice**.

#### OpenStack web dashboard (Horizon) logout

Keep in mind, that clicking **Sign Out** on the Horizon dashboard currently doesn't revoke your OIDC token, and any consequent
attempt to **Authenticate via Keycloak** will succeed without providing the credentials.

The expiration time of the Single Sign On tokens can be controlled on multiple levels in Keycloak.

1. On realm level under *Realm Settings* > *Tokens*.
   Assuming the *keycloak_realm* ansible variable is the default *osism*, and keycloak is listening on
   [keycloak.testbed.osism.xyz](https://keycloak.testbed.osism.xyz), then the configuration form is available
   [here](https://keycloak.testbed.osism.xyz/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/osism/token-settings).

   Detailed information is available in the Keycloak Server Administrator Documentation
   [Session and Token Timeouts](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/server_admin/#_timeouts) section.

2. In a realm down on the [client level](https://keycloak.testbed.osism.xyz/auth/admin/master/console/#/realms/osism/clients)
   select the client (keystone), and under *Settings* > *Advanced Settings*.

   It is recommended to keep the *Access Token Lifespan* on a relatively low value, with the trend of blocking third party
   cookies. For further information see the Keycloak documentation's [Browsers with Blocked Third-Party Cookies](https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#browsers-with-blocked-third-party-cookies) section.

#### OpenStack CLI operations with OpenID Connect password

Using the OpenStack cli is also possible via OIDC, assuming you provisioned the user **alice** with password **password**,
then you can perform a simple `project list` operation like this:

```sh
openstack \
 --os-cacert /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt \
 --os-auth-url https://api.testbed.osism.xyz:5000/v3 \
 --os-auth-type v3oidcpassword \
 --os-client-id keystone \
 --os-client-secret 0056b89c-030f-486b-a6ad-f0fa398fa4ad \
 --os-username alice \
 --os-password password \
 --os-identity-provider keycloak \
 --os-protocol openid \
 --os-identity-api-version 3 \
 --os-discovery-endpoint https://keycloak.testbed.osism.xyz/auth/realms/osism/.well-known/openid-configuration \
project list
```

#### OpenStack CLI token issue with OpenID Connect

It is also possible to exchange your username/password to a token, for further use with the cli.
The `token issue` subcommand returns an SQL table, in which the `id` column's `value` field contains the token:

```sh
openstack \
 --os-cacert /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt \
 --os-auth-url https://api.testbed.osism.xyz:5000/v3 \
 --os-auth-type v3oidcpassword \
 --os-client-id keystone \
 --os-client-secret 0056b89c-030f-486b-a6ad-f0fa398fa4ad \
 --os-username alice \
 --os-password password \
 --os-identity-provider keycloak \
 --os-protocol openid \
 --os-identity-api-version 3 \
 --os-discovery-endpoint https://keycloak.testbed.osism.xyz/auth/realms/osism/.well-known/openid-configuration \
 --os-openid-scope "openid profile email" \
token issue \
  -c id
  -f value
```

An example token is like:

```sh
gAAAAABhC98gL8nsQWknro3JWDXWLFCG3CDr3Mi9OIlvVAZMjy2mNgYtlXv_0yAIy-
nSlLAaLIGhht17-mwf8uclKgRuNVsYLSmgUpB163l89-ch2w2_OFe9zNSQNWf4qfd8
Cl7E7XvvUoFr1N8Gh09vaYLvRvYgCGV05xBUSs76qCHa0qElPUsk56s5ft4ALrSrzD

## Troubleshooting

### Unsupported locale setting

```sh
$ make prepare
ansible-playbook -i localhost, ansible/check-local-versions.yml
ERROR: Ansible could not initialize the preferred locale: unsupported locale setting
make: *** [prepare] Error 1
```

To solve the problem you have to modify the `Makefile`. Change the 1st line as follows.

```
export LC_ALL = en_US.UTF-8
```

To find out the locale used on the system `printenv` can be used.

```
$ printenv | grep -i lang|locale
LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_COLLATE="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_CTYPE="UTF-8"
LC_MESSAGES="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_MONETARY="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_NUMERIC="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_TIME="en_US.UTF-8"
LC_ALL=
```

### yq: No such file or directory

The following error occurs when yq is not installed.

```
make: yq: No such file or directory
```

`yq` must be installed on the system. [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) is a portable
command-line YAML, JSON, XML, CSV, TOML and properties processor.

## Notes

* The configuration is intentionally kept quite static. Please create no PRs to make the configuration more flexible/dynamic.
* The OSISM documentation uses hostnames, examples, addresses etc. from OSISM Testbed.
* Even if all components (storage, network, compute, control) are operated on the same nodes, there are separate networks.
  This is because in larger productive HCI environments, dedicated control nodes and network nodes are usually provided.
  It is also common to place storage frontend and storage backend on an independent/additional network infrastructure.
* The third volume (`/dev/sdd`) is not enabled for Ceph by default. This is to test the scaling of Ceph.
* Ansible errors that have something to do with undefined variables (e.g. `AnsibleUndefined`) are most likely due to cached
  facts that are no longer valid. The facts can be updated by running `osism apply facts`.
* The manager is used as pull through cache for Docker images and Ubuntu packages. This reduces the amount of traffic consumed.
* To speed up the Ansible playbooks, [ARA](https://ara.recordsansible.org) can be disabled. This
  is done by executing `/opt/configuration/scripts/disable-ara.sh`. Afterwards no more logs are available in the ARA web
  interface.
