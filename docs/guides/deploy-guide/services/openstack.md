# OpenStack

Common issues with deploying OpenStack services are documented in the
[OpenStack Troubleshooting Guide](../../troubleshooting-guide/openstack).

:::info

An OpenStack deployment contains a number of components providing APIs to access infrastructure resources.
The [OpenStack Components](https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator/openstack-components#openstack-services)
page lists the various services that can be deployed to provide such resources to cloud end users.
Unfortunately, not all of the OpenStack projects listed there are still active.
Not all of the services listed there are supported by OSISM.

:::

1. OpenStack client

   ```
   osism apply openstackclient
   ```

2. Keystone

   ```
   osism apply -a pull keystone
   osism apply keystone
   ```

3. Glance

   ```
   osism apply -a pull glance
   osism apply glance
   ```

4. Designate

   ```
   osism apply -a pull designate
   osism apply designate
   ```

5. Placement

   ```
   osism apply -a pull placement
   osism apply placement
   ```

6. Cinder

   ```
   osism apply -a pull cinder
   osism apply cinder
   ```

7. Neutron

   ```
   osism apply -a pull neutron
   osism apply neutron
   ```

8. Nova

   ```
   osism apply -a pull nova
   osism apply nova
   ```

9. Octavia

   ```
   osism apply -a pull octavia
   osism apply octavia
   ```

   9.1. Manage amphora image

   This step is only necessary if the Amphora Driver is used. If OVN is used as the driver,
   this step is not necessary.

   We provide regularly updated images for Octavia in
   [osism/openstack-octavia/amphora-image](https://github.com/osism/openstack-octavia-amphora-image).
   The OSISM CLI can be used to upload the correct image depending on the OpenStack release
   used.

   ```
   osism manage image octavia
   ```

10. Horizon

    ```
    osism apply -a pull horizon
    osism apply horizon
    ```
